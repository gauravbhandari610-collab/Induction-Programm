## 📅 Day 1: Welcome and Inauguration

The induction program commenced with a spiritually enriching experience at the **College Gurudwara Sahib**, where a peaceful session of **Path and Kirtan** was held. This spiritual beginning filled the environment with positivity and provided blessings to all the freshers for the exciting journey ahead at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC)**.

Post the spiritual session, a **refreshment break** was organized in front of **Hostel No. 2 (Boys)**. It was a great moment for new students to interact informally and get familiar with fellow batchmates.

We were then escorted to the **Auditorium Hall** for the **Inaugural Ceremony**. At the entrance, each student received a **Welcome Kit**, after which volunteers guided us to our respective seats. The ceremony commenced with encouraging speeches from esteemed dignitaries:

### 🎤 Guest Speakers Included:

- **Dr. Sehijpal Singh** (Principal, GNDEC)

## 📅 Day 2: Academic Orientation and Personal Growth

The day began with an **English Proficiency Test**. The test assessed our understanding of grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension. I found the difficulty level manageable and saw it as a good opportunity to evaluate my current command over English.

We then appeared for the **Mathematics Proficiency Test**, which covered essential concepts from **classes 10 to 12**. The questions were of medium difficulty, and it helped me realize that I need to brush up on certain topics from class 11 to strengthen my fundamentals.

Later in the afternoon, we attended a lecture by **Dr. Arshdeep Singh**, who delivered an enlightening session on the **importance of a balanced and nutritious diet**. He emphasized that proper intake of vitamins, minerals, and proteins contributes directly to our energy levels, focus, and mental well-being.

The day concluded with an interactive session organized by the **Causmic Club**, where we were introduced to various **extracurricular activities**, tech events, and student-driven initiatives. It was inspiring to see how active student involvement is encouraged at GNDEC.

## 📅 Day 3: Exploring Knowledge and Inner Self

We began the day with a highly engaging lecture by **Dr. Jaswinder Singh**, a man of great wisdom and humor. He beautifully connected **mathematics with real-life applications**, and made complex concepts enjoyable through experiments. His demonstration on **wave nature and sound** left a lasting impression and made learning fun and interactive.

This was followed by a motivational session by **Dr. Priya Darshani**, who guided us to look beyond academics. She explained the **difference between happiness and excitement**, and encouraged us to deeply **reflect on our life choices and aspirations**. She also gave us home assignments that involved **self-introspection**, helping us understand our strengths, values, and goals.

## 📅 Day 4: First Steps into Coding and Communication

We had our very first **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)** learning session, where **third-year seniors** mentored us. They introduced us to **basic programming concepts**, including types of variables and data types, and even guided us through writing our **first lines of code**. The balance of theory and hands-on practice made the session both informative and enjoyable.

Next, we had our **English communication class** conducted by **Prof. Manjot Kaur**. She made the environment light and interactive, taking introductions from each student and creating a space where everyone felt comfortable expressing themselves. This session was a great confidence booster.

The day concluded with another impactful session by **Dr. Priya Darshani**, where she continued from the previous day’s theme of **self-awareness and goal-setting**. Her sessions have been immensely thought-provoking and have made us reflect not just on our academic goals, but also on our personal growth and values.

## ✅ Conclusion

The induction program so far has been an incredible experience. It has not only introduced us to the academic culture of GNDEC but has also encouraged us to think holistically—focusing on learning, personality development, emotional intelligence, and well-being. The interactions with our seniors, faculty, and guest speakers have already started to shape a sense of direction and belonging.

The combination of lectures, peer learning, departmental visits, and club activities has made me feel excited and prepared to begin this new phase of my life. I look forward to the upcoming sessions with great enthusiasm and a strong commitment to grow both personally and professionally.
